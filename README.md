Exoplanets habitability analysis using the Open Exoplanet Catalogue (https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue)

That's my analysis of all discovered extra solar planets having similar features to Earth in terms of Mass and Temperature using Jupyter Notebook.

The 2 main features looked into are the surface temperature and the planetary mass.

Surface temperature: The temperature is calculated in Kelvin, which is a temperature scale 



Planetary mass: The planetary mass is calculated in Mjup (mass relative to Jupiter's mass)
